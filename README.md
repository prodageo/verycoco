# Verycoco (codename)

A versatile application to collect votes in a sprint retrospective based on a [_chase the state_](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/chase-the-state/) format.
Consists of two entry point :
- mobile: to let team members votes on each alpha selected for this retro
- desktop: to share the votes on a radar and start a discussion on state that differs from voters.
